This directory contains two packages for analyzing the FCAL LED skims:

FCALLEDTree:  a plugin to make ROOT trees from the FCAL LED skim files
fcal_led_analysis:  a package to analyze the ROOT tree output from FCALLEDTree

The analysis package was written and separately documented by Wyatt Campbell, an
REU student at Indiana U.
