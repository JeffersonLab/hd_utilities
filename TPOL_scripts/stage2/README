The main purpose of this code is to create the run dependent histograms
that are used to determine the polarization. 

Example on how to run: For run 90063, polarization plane at 0 degrees, with input 
file ../stage1/stage1Out_090063.root and output file ./tpolAna_090063.root

 ./stage2 ../stage1/stage1Out_090063.root -o./tpolAna_090063.root -p0 -r90063

NOTE: Example plots can be found in the analysis note 
( http://meson.hldsite.com/tpol/analysisNoteV2.pdf )

Some histograms that might be of interest:

root -l tpolAna_090063.root
   hTime->Draw()

You can compare to Figure 10 in the analysis note. NOTE: The peak
is at aproximately 300 ns for Sp 18 onward.

   hTimeVsPhi->Draw("colz")

The above plot shows the timing versus azimuthal angle.

   hEDepVsSector->Draw("colz")

The above plot shows the energy deposited in the silicon strip detector
vs the sector number. 

   hPhiCut->Draw()

The above shows the azimuthal distribution along with a fit to the data

   hPhiCutVsRun->Draw("colz") 

The above shows the azimuthal distribution as a function of run number
NOTE: Only interesting when many run files are added together

    hPolVsRun->Draw()

The above shows the polarization versus the run number
