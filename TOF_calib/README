TOF TDC calibration of ALL paddle PMTS
--------------------------------------
This is a new calibration version that is modified to use the ADC signal amplitudes
to determine the walk correction of the TDC times.
The main script that controls all steps of the calibration "DO_CALIB.csh" is modified
to do the meantime script and time difference script in parallel threads to improve
speed when running on the farm nodes (requires two cores(nodes)).
Of course prior to running these scripts the basic root files need to be available.

After the calibration there are python and root scripts that facilitate reviewing the results
and writing the resulting calibration parameters to the database tables.

The latest CCDB data base tables that are now used to write the calibration results are:
/TOF2/walkcorr_type : this contains a flag to indicate which walk correction type was used
/TOF2/timewalk_parms_5PAR : contains the walk correction parameters
/TOF2/timing_offsets_5PAR : contains the final timing offsets of the TDCs values of each PMT
/TOF2/propagation_speed : contains the effective speed of light in each paddle
/TOF2/adc_timing_offsets : contains the timing offsets for the ADCs values of each PMT

Note: the "TOF2/" directory is to indicate that the calibration code is up to date to handle
      the new TOF geometry. The code is backwards compatible to use the old geometry "TOF/".


FIRST GENERATE THE ROOT FILES FROM RAW DATA REQUIRED FOR CALIBRATION:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   analyze data with plugin "TOF_calib" (src/plugins/Calibration/TOF_calib/)
   creates root files in "localdir/tofdata_run####_*.root"            
   add root files  together: "hadd big99999.root tofdata_run#####_*.root"

   Note: this is done prior to any calibration attempt. Most of the time this is done by a dedicated
         operator who handles other detector skim data as well.
   Note: For regular GlueX running about 60 raw evio files are required to get sufficient statistics
         for the calibration. Generally the size of the summed up root file should be 10GB or more.
         "summed up" means the root files from each evio file are added together using "hadd".

THE ACTUAL CALIBRATION IS DONE IN STEPS CONTROLLED BY THE MASTER SCRIPT "DO_CALIB.CSH"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   All the callibration is now done with one command
   ./DO_CALIB.csh "####" where "####" is the run number
   the input data files is expected to be in localdir
   with the name "tofdata_run####.root"
   or "big99999.root" if #### = 99999

The Following is a descrption of all the root scripts and shell scripts used:

1) DO_CALIB.csh : main shell scripts that does it all

2)  calculate walk correction parameters with src/walk1.C 
    output: tof_walk_parameters_run#####dat
            tof_TDC_ADC_timediff_run#####.dat
            walk_histos_run#####.root
            walk_results_run#####.root
            tof_walk_parameters_run#####.DB                : the walk parameters from the fit
            adc_vs_tdc_relative_global_time_run#####.DB    : global time difference between TDC and ADC
            adc_vs_tdc_relative_time_run#####.DB           : relative time differnece between TDC and ADC time
    Note: this one of the most critical steps and will result in the largest values of correction
          for the timing. The functional form of the walk correction has been modifed several times and
          as a result the subsequent use of these parameters is controlled by a flag located in the CCDB data base
          table /TOF2/walkcorr_type. 

3) domeantime.csh to calculate all meantimes for both planes
   it uses the root script wrapper src/MT1.C to compile and run
   the codes in the root script src/meantime1.C 
   if DEBUG is set to 2 it will also generate lots of plots
   output: mtpos_refpadXplaneY.dat   X=0,..,43 Y=0,1
           mtparameters_plane0_ref18.dat

4)root -b -q "src/meantime2.C" generate all mean time differences for refrence paddles 
   in the first plane. The main reference paddle is chosen to be paddle 18.
   output file:   "calibration/mtparameters_plane0_ref18.dat"

 
5) ./dotimediff.csh $ to calculate all time differences it uses the root script
   src/TDIFF.C as wrapper to compile and run the code in the root script
   src/timedifference.C
   output:  deltat_tpos_refpadXplaneY.dat   X=0,..,43 Y=0,1

6) src/tdlook.C(plane) tool to detemine effective speed of light in paddles.
   output files: 
   tof_speeds_plane0.dat
   tof_timediffoffsets_plane0.dat
   tof_speeds_plane1.dat
   tof_timediffoffsets_plane1.dat
   tofpaddles_propagation_speed_run####.DB

7) src/consolidate.C(RUNNUMBER) calculate individual pmt TDC offsets requiring
   the input files:
   tof_timediffoffsets_plane0.dat, 
   tof_timediffoffsets_plane1.dat
   mtparameters_plane0_ref18.dat

   generating the output files: 
   tofpmt_tdc_offsets_all.dat
   tofpmt_tdc_offsets_all_run####.DB

8) root -b -q "src/dofitall.C(RUNNUMBER,10)"
   get offsets for single ended readout paddles located at the center of the TOF
   runs src/dofitall.C
   output files:
   tofpmt_tdc_offsets_all_FULL_run####.DB
   adchists_runXXXX.root with histograms: 
   histograms: TimingN          TDC offsets of single ended pmt M
               xTvsxEN          xpos from TDC vs xpos from E for paddle N
               TDiff_TDCvsADC
               ENvsxEN
               ADCHistsN        ADC Integral for PMT N for central hit
               xTvsEPMTN        xpos from TDC vs ADC Integral for pmt N
               xTvsEPMTcorrN
               TimingX          timing histograms

9) root -b -q "src/doadctimeoffsets.C+($RUN)"
   calculate the timing offsets for the ADC time values based on their relative value to the 
   corrected TDC times.
