This directory contains the scripts necessary to run the cron job
for processing new run as they come in.
See also instructions at
https://halldweb1.jlab.org/wiki/index.php/Data_Monitoring_Procedures

To run the cron job do
crontab cron_plugins

To check that the cron job is running do
crontab -l

To stop the cron job do
crontab -r

The cron job runs the script scan_for_jobs.sh.
This script will search for new files that appear on /mss,
and use the script generatejobs_plugins_rawdata.sh to create
jobs for those files. The basic structure of generatejobs_plugins_rawdata.sh
is the same as that in /home/gxproj1/halld/monitoring/batch.

If it is necessary to roll back to a previous environment, use
setup_previous.sh [year] [month] [day]
This will set the sqlite date context, HDDS, sim-recon, and plugin
builds to the date specified using the XML files that were generated
on those dates (assuming they exist).
