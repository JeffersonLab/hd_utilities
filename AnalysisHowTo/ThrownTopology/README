# Tutorial for Analysis How To's (JRS 7/3/19)

# In this tutorial we show how to identify the thrown particle topology in the DSelector and fill histograms based on the TString associated with the topology 

# Step 1) Open gp -> etapi0p ROOT tree and fill histograms in PROOF
root -l -b -q runSelector.C

# see files from analysis launch of bggen at /cache/halld/RunPeriod-2017-01/analysis/bggen/batch01/tree_pi0eta__B4_M17_M7/merged/ (these may need to be pulled from tape)

# Step 2) Plot thrown topology selected histograms
root -l plotThrownTopology.C

# Notes:
# This should be added as a DHistogramAction in the future but is currently done in the individual analyzer's DSelector for people to try it out and identify issues
