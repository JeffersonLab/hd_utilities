# Accidental subtraction tutorial for Analysis How To's (JRS 4/18/18)

# In this tutorial there 2 approaches to subtracting accidentals 
#   1) Fill a weighted histogram in the DSelector, where the weights account for the accidental subtraction.
#   2) Fill a histogram for "prompt" beam photons (in time with the RF bunch of the combo) and a separate histogram for "accidental" beam photosn (out of time with the RF bunch of the combo).  In this approach the accidental subtraction is performed in Step 3) below.

# Important notes for writing your DSelector code (see example DSelector for more details):
#   * To fill weighted histograms in your DSelector they CANNOT be defined as TH1I (integer precision).   
#   * If you intend to fill unweighted histograms and do accidental subtraction in a second step outside your DSelector, you must set Sumw2() for your histograms to store the squared weights for correct error propagation.

# Step 1) Open gp -> ggp ROOT tree 
root -l -b tree_gg__B3.root

# see /work/halld/home/jrsteven/AnalysisHowTo/tree_gg__B3.root for an example or files from analysis launch at /cache/halld/RunPeriod-2017-01/analysis/verNN/tree_gg__B3/merged/ (these may need to be pulled from tape)

# Step 2) Run DSelector to fill histograms for accidental subtraction
root [1] .x $ROOT_ANALYSIS_HOME/scripts/Load_DSelector.C
root [2] gg__B3_Tree->Process("DSelector_gg.C+")

# Step 3) Plot accidental subtracted MM^2 distribition from 2 approaches
root -l plotAccidentalSubtracted.C

# Summary of resulting figure:
#   -Top left: the beam DeltaT distribution with 3 out of time RF bunches on each side of the prompt peak.
#   -Top right: accidental subtracted MM^2 distribution using event weights applied in the DSelector (black)
#   -Bottom left: MM^2 distribution for prompt peak (|DeltaT| < 2.004 ns, red) and accidental tags, weighted by 1/6 (|DeltaT| > 2.004, blue)
#   -Bottom right accidental subtracted MM^2 distribution from subtracting the prompt and accidental histograms (magenta)
#   Note: both the Top and Bottom right histograms contain the same contents, so the 2 approaches are equivalent in terms of accidental subtraction
