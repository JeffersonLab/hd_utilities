Steps to run DSelector to determine the photon reconstruction efficiencies using the Costhe Eff method.
July 13, 2020

The is a preliminary setup for Data and MC is a little different:

Data setup:

i. For the data, one starts with the output trees of the event filter specifying for the reaction 1_14__7_8_9_14 (g p -> pi0 pi+ pi- p). The are generated as part
   of the GlueX analysis launches. The files are found for example in /cache/halld/RunPeriod-2017-01/analysis/ver27/tree_pi0pippim__B4/merged/tree*.root.

MC setup:

i. Events are generated with the output of g p -> pi0 pi+ pi- p and simulated using HDGeant4.
   For FCAL, use g p -> omega p events with a Bslope = 6 GeV2. Examples of the output can be found at 
             /cache/halld/gluex_simulations/REQUESTED_MC/gen_omega_3pi_efficiency_2017_01_20200525020622pm/hddm/dana_rest_gen_amp_*.hddm
   For BCAL, FCAL/BCAL, use g p  -> pi0 pi+ pi- p, where M(pi0pi+pi-) peaks at about 1.2 GeV with a wide distribution, and B = 2.5 GeV-2. Examples can be found at 
             ............

ii. The REST (.hddm) files must be processed with the reaction filter to produce root trees. This is accomplished with the following command:
    > hd_root ${indir}dana_rest_gen_amp_${run}.hddm --config=jana.config, where ${indir} is the residing directory and ${run} is the run_file identifier.


Processing:

1. The data and/or the MC root trees are processed using the DSelector as follows:
   > root -b -q tree_pi0pippim__B4.root 'call_DSelector.C("DSelector_pi0pippim__B4_ver21.C+")'
   Save the output root histograms to the desired ${outdir} direcgtory
   > cp DSelector_pi0pippim__B4.root ${outdir}/DSelector_pi0pippim__B4_gen_amp_${run}.root

2. Edit the script plot_compare2DEff.C to point to the appropriate data and MC root files to obtaine comparison plots of data and MC.
   > root -l
   > .x plot_compare2DEff.C
