###############      Introduction       #######################
This directory contains scripts to indroduce tweaks to the nominal DIRC geometry.
The functionality is realized by calling the tweak_DIRC.py script with a config file, such as:

$ python tweak_DIRC.py config.cfg

It takes an input geometry xml file, performs the desired tweaks, and output a tweaked geometry xml
file which then can be fed to the rest of the simulation chain. The desired tweaks and the input/output xml files
are all specified using the config file.

###############      Config file       #######################
A config file should look something like the config.cfg in this directory.

The "FILES" section specifies the input("NOMINAL") and the output ("OUTPUT") xml files. The input "NOMINAL" file should exit
in order to run tweaks on it (by definition). The "OUTPUT" file should be fed to the rest of the simulation chain.

The other sections specify the tweaks/perturbations one wants to introduce to the nominal. All numbers correspond 
to the perturbations w.r.t. the nominal. Currently, the implemented tweaks are as follows:

- OBCS(N)_rot: the overall rotation angles of optical box south (north). The 3 numbers correspond to rotations along 
X, Y and Z axes respectively, following the hdds convention. For instance, Z-axis angle rotation should be positive 
when rotation is made in the direction from X to Y in the short way.

- OBCS(N)_offset: the overll offsets of the optical box south (north)

- TSM(#)_rot: the rotation of three-segment mirror (#)
