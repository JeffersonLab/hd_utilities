RunPeriod-2019-10  (Estimates

This estimates values for the High Intensity GlueX running based on
what we know as of today. Note that many values here are taken from
RunPeriod-2017-01.xml where there are more extensive comments describing
how each of the values were derived.

2018-11-12 : Copied from HigIntensity_Projection.xml and modified DL
2019-09-16 : Updated to reflect new accelerator schedule. Currently:
             Nov. 25 - Dec. 19 or 25 days

=====================================================================
triggerRate

Assume 90kHz entire time

=====================================================================
runningTimeOnFloor

According to published schedule, Hall-D will run from Nov. 1 - Dec. 19
in 2019. Word on the street though is that the start date is delayed
to Nov. 25th. This is a total of 25 days.

=====================================================================
runningEfficiency

Nominally, the acclerator runs at around 50%-60% efficiency. We assume
50%.

=====================================================================
eventsize

Earlier projections estimated this at being more than 16.5kB/event.
The high intensity test run 42377 taken at 4.6E7 g/s during Spring
2018 had an average event size for 300nA running (file 023) that was
only 12.5kB. When I asked Alex S. about it, he was a little surprised
and did not know right away why it was so much lower. We use 13kB/event
here assuming the values in 42377 as well as the other 2018 data were
lower due to other optimizations.

=====================================================================
eventsPerRun

Number of events (in millions) in a production run. We assume 400M.
With 50% accelerator efficiency, this would be about 2.5hr/run

=====================================================================
compressionFactor

This is how much we anticipate compressing the data stream prior to
storage. Here are some compression factors for different algorithms
used on a file from run 51505:

compression type  file size  fraction  factor
- - - - - - - -   - - - - -  - - - -   - - - -
    none           19.5GB     100.0%     1.00
    lz4-1          15.9GB      81.5%     1.23
    lz4-9          14.3GB      73.3%     1.36
    gzip           12.6GB      64.6%     1.55
    bzip2          11.4GB      58.5%     1.71

At this point in time the exact compression mechanism is not fully
in place and tests (9/16/2019). We therefore estimate a compression
factor of 1.4

=====================================================================
RESTfraction

The number used for RunPeriod-2017-01 was based on files that were 14.6%
the size of the 20GB raw data files. Here we round up to 15%.

n.b. This is the ratio of the REST file size to the uncompressed
raw data size.

=====================================================================
goodRunFraction

This is taken from the RunPeriod-2017-01 number of 85%

=====================================================================
reconstructionRate

Following values used for RunPeriod-2018-01 estimate assume 5.5Hz.

=====================================================================
reconPasses

Expect 2 full reconstruction passes.

=====================================================================
analysisRate

We use the rate for RunPeriod-2017-01 of 75Hz

=====================================================================
analysisPasses

We use the empirical value for RunPeriod-2017-01 of 2.82

=====================================================================
cores

Based on conversations with Chip, assume 10000 cores for now. The goal
is to do most of the recon pass at NERSC.

=====================================================================
incomingData

proportional to number of runs

Number of files per run analyzed for the "incoming data" jobs. This
is always 5.

=====================================================================
calibRate

proportinal to time on floor

This value represents the number of Mhr of CPU used per week of running
to calibrate the detector. The value of 0.530 is taken from the
RunPeriod-2017-01 number.

=====================================================================
offlineMonitoring

proportional to number of runs

The value of 0.00800 is taken from the RunPeriod-2017-01 number.

=====================================================================
miscUserStudies

proportional to time to process all files of single run

This value is used to capture the CPU usage by all of the various users
that is attributed to the gluex project. Some of this should probably
go under calibRate, but it is very hard to categorize which parts of
this should go there.

It is assumed here that these are jobs that run over all files from a
small number of runs in order to do special studies. The amount of CPU
required is therefore proportional to the time it takes to process a
single production run.

The value of 810 is taken from the RunPeriod-2017-01 number.

=====================================================================
simulationRate

This is based on a very rough value Thomas B. gave of 40ms/event for
bggen events with real data background mixed in. Note that adding the
background this way significantly reduced the compute time required
from previous models.

=====================================================================
simulationpasses

Number of times we will need to repeat simulation. This value of
2 is an old estimate.

=====================================================================
simulatedPerRawEvent

Number of simulated events needed for each raw data event (production
runs only) This is assumed to be 2 simulated events for each signal
event in the raw data stream. We estimate about 20% of the raew data
is reconstructable (see "GlueX at High Intensity" talk slide 10
here:  https://halldweb.jlab.org/wiki/index.php/GlueX-II_and_DIRC_ERR )
