2018-11-12 : Copied from RunPeriod-2018-01.xml and HighIntensity_Projection.xml  and modified

=====================================================================
triggerRate

Trigger rate has been roughly 45kHz

=====================================================================
runningTimeOnFloor

See https://www.jlab.org/exp_prog/experiment_schedule/2018/20181108.2.pdf

Schedule shows us running from 9/26/2018 - 11/26/2018 (shutting off
the morning of 11/26) This gives 60 days. There was some lost time
due to accelerator issues that cost nearly 1 month, but that appears
to have been adjusted for in the start date on the schedule already.
Thus, we use 60 days.

=====================================================================
runningEfficiency

The number 44% (0.44) was tuned such that for 43 days of running would
give approximately 855TB of raw data. This is the amount reported by
the scicomp webpage as of today (11/12/2018) which is about 43 days
into the run.

=====================================================================
eventsize

Earlier projections estimated this at being more than 16.5kB/event.
The high intensity test run 42377 taken at 4.6E7 g/s during Spring
2018 had an average event size for 300nA running (file 023) that was
only 12.5kB. When I asked Alex S. about it, he was a little surprised
and did not know right away why it was so much lower. We use 13kB/event
here assuming the values in 42377 as well as the other 2018 data were
lower due to other optimizations.

=====================================================================
eventsPerRun

Number of events (in millions) in a production run. The current runs
are limited to <= 2hr based on a request from the CDC detector group
as that is roughly the time scale of calibration drifts. A visual scan
of the run period up to now indicates roughly 200M events on average.

=====================================================================
RESTfraction

The number used for RunPeriod-2017-01 was based on files that were 14.6%
the size of the 20GB raw data files. Here we round up to 15%.

n.b. This is the ratio of the REST file size to the uncompressed
raw data size.

=====================================================================
goodRunFraction

This is taken from the RunPeriod-2017-01 number of 85%

=====================================================================
reconstructionRate

Following values used for RunPeriod-2018-01 estimate assume 5.5Hz.

=====================================================================
reconPasses

Expect 2 full reconstruction passes.

=====================================================================
analysisRate

We use the rate for RunPeriod-2017-01 of 75Hz

=====================================================================
analysisPasses

We use the empirical value for RunPeriod-2017-01 of 2.82

=====================================================================
cores

Based on conversations with Chip, assume 10000 cores for now. The goal
is to do most of the recon pass at NERSC.

=====================================================================
incomingData

proportional to number of runs

Number of files per run analyzed for the "incoming data" jobs. This
is always 5.

=====================================================================
calibRate

proportinal to time on floor

This value represents the number of Mhr of CPU used per week of running
to calibrate the detector. The value of 0.530 is taken from the
RunPeriod-2017-01 number.

=====================================================================
offlineMonitoring

proportional to number of runs

The value of 0.00800 is taken from the RunPeriod-2017-01 number.

=====================================================================
miscUserStudies

proportional to time to process al files of single run

This value is used to capture the CPU usage by all of the various users
that is attributed to the gluex project. Some of this should probably
go under calibRate, but it is very hard to categorize which parts of
this should go there.

It is assumed here that these are jobs that run over all files from a
small number of runs in order to do special studies. The amount of CPU
required is therefore proportional to the time it takes to process a
single production run.

The value of 810 is taken from the RunPeriod-2017-01 number.

=====================================================================
simulationRate

This is based on a very rough value Thomas B. gave of 40ms/event for
bggen events with real data background mixed in. Note that adding the
background this way significantly reduced the compute time required
from previous models.

=====================================================================
simulationpasses

Number of times we will need to repeat simulation. This value of
2 is an old estimate.

=====================================================================
simulatedPerRawEvent

Number of simulated events needed for each raw data event (production
runs only) This is assumed to be 2 simulated events for each signal
event in the raw data stream. We estimate about 20% of the raw data
is reconstructable (see "GlueX at High Intensity" talk slide 10
here:  https://halldweb.jlab.org/wiki/index.php/GlueX-II_and_DIRC_ERR )
