Hi Mark,

  After the CLAS12 review and discussion this afternoon, it got me thinking about our numbers
a little more. Sorry for the length of this, but I wanted to write it down while I was thinking of it.

First off, Iâ€™m using some numbers from a recent recon launch of 2017 data found here:

https://halldweb.jlab.org/data_monitoring/recon/summary_swif_output_recon_2017-01_ver02_batch01.html

Time to complete 1 job: ~4hrs
Number of events in file: ~1.8M
Event rate for 24thread job: 1.8M/4hr = 125Hz  or  5.2Hz/core

If we use 3k core allocation on farm, total recon rate is: 3k * 5.2 = 15.6kHz

DAQ runs at ~45kHz now (high luminosity will be double). This means it will
take us about 3x longer to reconstruct than to acquire data. 

If we ran 10 weeks in 2017 with duty factor of 0.5, then it should take: (10 weeks) * 0.5 * 3 = 15 weeks
to process full data set. According to above link, it took only 864hrs for batch1 and 350 hrs for batch 2
which is 7 weeks. Maybe this is due to use having exclusive use of farm (~6k core equivalent)?

If we double our rate for high lumi and really get just 3k cores of the farm since CLAS12 is running
at same time, the time to process will go up a factor of 4. i.e. it will take 30 weeks to process a 10
calendar week run. If we actually run 20 weeks a year (which is still less than what management 
is pushing for), it will take 60 weeks to recon a single pass.

Bottom line: our event processing rate may end up 2.5 times faster than CLAS12 (if they make their
improvements), but our DAQ rate is going to be 6 times more. This would put us in worse shape
than CLAS12.

It would be great if you could double check me on this and then we can discuss it.

Regards,
-David
