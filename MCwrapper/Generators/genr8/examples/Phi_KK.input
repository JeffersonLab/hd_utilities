%    genr8 input file usage:

%            genr8 -M100 -Aoutput.ascii -n < reaction.input
%
% Example: gamma p -> p X(1600)          (All decays are isotropic)
%                      X -> pi+ pi- pi0
%                                       pi0->2gamma   
%
%  hint: use "-n" flag to actually print the particle names in the
%        the output for viewing/debuging, but remember not to use "-n" 
%        for data that is used as input to HDFast.
