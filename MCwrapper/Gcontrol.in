c This is the control file for the GEANT simulation.  Parameters defined
c in this file control the kind and extent of simulation that is performed.
c The full list of options is given in section BASE-40 of the GEANT manual.
c
c In addition, some new cards have been defined to set up the input source
c for the simulation.  Three kinds of simulation runs are available, selected
c by which of the following three "cards" are present below.
c    1. Input from Monte Carlo generator (card INFILE)
c    2. Built-in coherent bremsstrahlung source (card BEAM)
c    3. Built-in single-track event generator (card KINE)
c The order of the list is significant, that is if INFILE is present then the
c BEAM and KINE cards are ignored, otherwise if BEAM is present then KINE is
c ignored.  For example, the 3-card sequence:
c     INFILE 'phi-1680.hddm'
c     SKIP 25
c     TRIG 100
c instructs HDGeant to open ./phi-1680.hddm, skip the first 25 events and then
c process the following 100 input events and stop.  If the end of the file is
c reached before the event count specified in card TRIG is exhausted then the
c processing will stop at the end of file.
INFILE 'TEMPIN'
SKIP TEMPSKIP
TRIG TEMPTRIG
RUNG TEMPRUNG

c The BEAM card configures the built-in coherent bremsstralung photon
c beam generator in HDGeant.  If the INFILE card is not present and BEAM
c is specified, the internal coherent bremsstralung generator is the primary
c source of events for the simulation.  If INFILE is specified, the primary
c event source is the external Monte Carlo generator that produced the file,
c but the BEAM card may still be present, and it is needed if beam-related
c backgrounds are being superimposed on top of the primary event signals,
c as requested with the BGRATE card (see below).  The beam card accepts
c the following five parameters.  
c      Emax   - end-point energy of the electron beam (GeV)
c      Epeak  - energy of the primary coherent peak edge (GeV)
c      Emin   - minimum energy of the coherent bremsstrahlung beam (GeV)
c      collz  - z position of collimator in m
c      colld  - diameter of collimator in m 
c      Eemit  - electron beam emittance in m.rad
c      radthick - dimaond radiator thickneess in m
c Omitting the final parameter Emin results in the default value being used.
c Setting Epeak to zero selects an amorphous radiator instead of diamond.
BEAM TEMPELECE TEMPCOHERENT TEMPMINE 76.00 TEMPCOLD 10.e-9 TEMPRADTHICK

c The GENBEAM card configures the simulation program to act purely as a
c Monte Carlo event generator, and not to actually track any of the particles
c that it generates. The events are written to the output file with only the
c MC section filled out (reactions tag). This file can be fed back later to
c HDGeant using the INFILE card above to carry out the actual simulation.
c This provides access to the built-in photon beam generator of HDGeant to
c someone who wants to study the properties of the beam apart from its
c interactions in the target. Three keywords are currently supported.
c    'precol'   - single-photon events starting upstream of the primary
c                 collimator, with correlated spatial and momentum 
c                 distributions for the well-tuned GlueX beamline.
c    'postcol'  - single-photon events starting downstream of the secondary
c                 collimator. Beam photons have been tracked through the 
c                 system of collimators and sweep magnets but then stopped
c                 before entry into the pair spectrometer.
c    'postconv' - e+e- pair and e+e-/e-recoil events generated in the
c                 TPOL target. Beam photons have been tracked through
c                 the system of collimators and then pair-converted in
c                 the TPOL coverter using a custom polarization-sensitive
c                 pair/triplet production generator. They are saved as
c                 a single vertex within the PTAR target.
c The first two modes are supported by both HDGeant and HDGeant4, while
c postconv is only supported at present by HDGeant4.

c Commenting out the following line will disable simulated hits output.
OUTFILE 'TEMPOUT'

c The following are used to automatically invoke the mcsmear program
c to do the final stage digitization of hits after the simulation
c stage is complete. This simply invokes the mcsmear program passing
c it any optional arguments supplied here and then optionally deletes
c the OUTFILE specified above leaving only the smeared file. This stage
c can be invoked by hand afterwards, but having it done automatically
c here allows hdgeant and mcsmear to function as though it were a single
c program. The specific keys are as follows.
c
c POSTSMEAR  - set this 1 to auto-invoke the mcsmear program and 0 to not
c DELETEUNSMEARED - set this to 1 to delete the OUTFILE after running mcsmear
c MCSMEAROPTS - String to specify additional arguments to pass to mcsmear
POSTSMEAR 0

c MCSMEAROPTS '-t1000 -d0'

c The following card enables single-track generation (for testing).
c For a single-particle gun, set the momentum (GeV/c), direction
c theta,phi (degrees) and vertex position (cm), and for the particle
c type insert the Geant particle type code plus 100 (eg. 101=gamma,
c 103=electron, 107=pi0, 108=pi+, 109=pi-, 114=proton).  If you use
c the particle code but do not add 100 then theta,phi are ignored
c and the particle direction is generated randomly over 4pi sr.
c For a listing of the Geant particle types, see the following URL.
c http://wwwasdoc.web.cern.ch/wwwasdoc/geant_html3/node72.html
c The meaning of the arguments to KINE are as follows.
c  - particle = GEANT particle type of primary track + 100
c  - momentum = initial track momentum, central value (GeV/c)
c  - theta = initial track polar angle, central value (degrees)
c  - phi = initial track azimuthal angle, central value (degrees)
c  - delta_momentum = spread in initial track momentum, full width (GeV/c)
c  - delta_theta = spread in initial track polar angle, full width (degrees)
c  - delta_phi = spread in initial track azimuthal angle, full width (degrees)
c
c If you do explicitly specify the momentum/angle (by adding 100 as
c described above, you may also choose to distibute tracks evenly in
c log(P) or log(theta) by setting the appropriate PLOG and TLOG flags
c to a non-zero value.

c The SCAP card determines the vertex position for the particle gun.  It
c supports the following three arguments, all of which default to 0.
c
c    vertex_x vertex_y vertex_z
cSCAP    0.       0.      65.

c The TGTWIDTH card is used to determine an extended volume from
c which the particle gun will generate vertexes. The vertex position
c is sampled evenly from a cylindrical volume whose radius is given
c by the first parameter and whose full z-extent is given by the second.
c The volume is centered on the coordinates specified by SCAP above.
c If the card is not specified, then both the r and z extent default
c to zero meaning the vertex is always located at the point specified
c by SCAP. Note that this only affects the particle gun. Events read
c from a file contain their own vertex information.

c If you specify a non-zero value for vertex_x and/or vertex_y above then
c all tracks will emerge from the given point.  If you leave them at zero,
c you have the option of specifying the HALO card which causes the simulation
c to generate events with a transverse profile modeled after the 12 GeV
c electron beam.  The argument only argument to HALO is fhalo, the fraction
c of the beam that lies in the halo region surrounding the core gaussian.
c The nominal value taken from CASA technical note JLAB-TN-06-048 is 5e-5.
c This card is only effective for electron beam simulations with gxtwist.

c    fhalo
HALO  5e-5

c The following lines control the rate (GHz) of background beam photons
c that are overlayed on each event in the simulation, in addition to the
c particles produced by the standard generation mechanism. BGGATE expects
c two values in ns, which define the window around the trigger time that
c background beam photons are overlaid on the simulation. The value you
c should enter for BGRATE depends on many details of the photon beam: the
c endpoint energy, the low-energy cutoff to be used in generating beam
c photons, the location of coherent edge, the electron beam spot size and
c emittance at the primary collimator, the electron beam current, etc. To
c find the setting that is right for you, follow these steps in order.
c  1) Check the BEAM card above that it has correct values for the electron
c     beam energy (field 1) and the low-energy cutoff that you want to use
c     in your simulation (field 3). Remember these values.
c  2) Open a new tab in a web browser and enter the following URL,
c     http://zeus.phys.uconn.edu/halld/cobrems/ratetool.cgi which displays
c     a form containing many fields describing the electron beam and the
c     photon beamline. Enter the correct values in all fields in the
c     left-most column of parameters. The right column of parameters 
c     defines the windows over which the tool will compute integrals of
c     the beam rate. Set the "end-point" window to span the full range
c     from your beamEmin (see step 1 above) to the electron beam endpoint,
c     Then click the Plot Spectrum button. After a few seconds, the form will
c     respond with a few plots and rate numbers in bold text. Record the
c     value given for the "end-point rate". This is your BGRATE value.
c  3) Enter your BGRATE value found in step 2 after BGRATE in the line
c     below, and remove any characters before the BGRATE keyword. You are
c     now ready to go. If you ever change anything in the beamline geometry
c     eg. the collimator diameter, the coherent edge position, or the value
c     of beamEmin, do not forget to come back and change your BGRATE.
BGGATE -200. 200.
BGRATE TEMPBGRATE

c The above cards BGRATE, BGGATE normally cause the simulation to add
c accidental tagger hits to the simulated output record, in addition to
c adding these beam photons to the list of particles to be tracked through
c the detector. If you want the accidental tagger hits to be added to the
c simulated output record but you do not want to track the background
c beam photons, remove the comment in front of BGTAGONLY below.
c NOTICE: If you turn on BGTAGONLY then you might as well raise the
c minimum energy of beam photons being generated to the lower bound of
c the tagger energy range you are interested in, which might be 3 GeV for
c low-intensity running, 7 GeV for high-intensity running, or even 8 GeV
c if you are only interested in the region of the coherent peak. This
c minimum is the third field of the BEAM card above. Remember that if
c you change beamEmin, you also need to change BGRATE to match, as 
c described above.
BGTAGONLY TEMPBGTAGONLY

c The following line controls the uncertainty of the event time reference
c relative to the RF structure of the beam. The event time reference is
c normally set by the level 1 trigger, whose transitions are synced to
c a clock in the trigger processor whose resolution is more coarse than
c the accelerator RF clock. Using a digitized copy of the RF clock signal,
c all times in the event can be synchronized offline to a nearby RF bucket,
c but the RF bucket closest to the trigger time will not in general be the 
c one that contained the beam photon that produced the trigger. The spread
c of trigger RF buckets times relative to the interaction RF bucket is
c set by the TREFSIGMA card below, specified as a RMS value in ns. The
c the displacement of the (unknown) true RF bucket from the trigger RF
c bucket will be generated by the simulation in multiples of 2 ns. If
c this line is commented out, a default value of 10ns is assumed. The
c decimal point is significant.
TREFSIGMA 10.

c The following card seeds the random number generator, though it may be
c overridden if seeds are found in the input file (see below). It must be
c unique for each run.  There are two ways to specify the random seed here.
c  1. One argument, must be an integer in the range [1,215]
c  2. Two arguments, must be a pair of positive Integer*4 numbers
c In the first case, one of a limited set of prepared starting seeds is
c chosen from a list.  These seeds have been certified to produce random
c sequences that do not repeat within the first 10^9 or so random numbers.
c For cases where more choices are needed, the two-argument form gives
c access to a total of 2^62 choices, with no guarantees about closed loops.
c
c NOTE: If one uses events read from an HDDM file and that file contains
c random number seeds for the event, those seeds will be used, overwriting
c any value(s) specified here. Most event generators do not include the
c seeds. The seeds are written to the output HDDM file though so if one
c uses the output file for input to another invocation of hdgeant(++)
c then the same seeds will be used. You may check for seeds in the input
c file using hddm-xml file.hddm | grep random .

CUTS 1e-4 1e-4 1e-3 1e-3 1e-4

c Geant4 introduced the concept of ?a unique cut in range? which allows the user
c to specify the threshold for secondaries production in terms of the range that
c the secondary would have in the medium in which it is generated, rather than
c in terms of a threshold energy. The RANGECUT card below supports the same
c sequence as the first 5 arguments of the CUTS card above, except that the
c values are interpreted as threshold ranges (cm) instead of kinetic energies.
c This card is supported by hdgeant4 only. It is complementary to the CUTS card
c in that CUTS are applied to the corresponding particles when they are being
c tracked, whereas RANGECUTS are used to decide whether they should be
c generated (as secondaries) in the first place.

cRANGECUTS 0.1 0.1 1.0 1.0 0.1

c Geant4 physics models are more comprehensive than the ones provided in G3,
c and one consequence of this is that some particles (eg. neutrons) seem to go
c on and on in Geant4 for lifetimes of many seconds in some cases. The following
c card tells the simulation to stop tracks that are still being followed after 
c this much time (seconds) has gone by. This card is only supported by hdgeant4.
c There is an equivalent feature in hdgeant3 (see field 12 of CUTS card above)
c but normally it is not needed to get efficient operation, so it is almost
c never needed.

c The following line controls a set of generic flags that are used to
c control aspects of the simulation generally related to debugging.
c For normal debugging runs these should be left at zero (or omitted).
c At present the following functionality is defined (assumes debug on).
c  SWIT(2) = 0 turns off trajectory tracing
c          = 2 turns on step-by-step trace during tracking (verbose!)
c          = 3 turns on trajectory plotting after tracking is done
c          = 4 turns on step-by-step plotting during tracking
c  SWIT(3) = 1 stores track trajectories for plotting after tracking is done

c The following cards are needed if optical photons are being
c being generated and tracked in the simulation.  The CKOV directive
c enables Cerenkov generation in materials for which the refractive
c index table has been specified.  The LABS card enables absorption
c of optical photons.  The ABAN directive controls a special feature
c of Geant which allows it to "abandon" tracking of charged particles
c once their remaining range drops below the distance to the next
c discrete interaction or geometric boundary.  Particles abandoned
c during tracking are stopped immediately and dump all remaining energy
c where they lie.  The remaining energy is dumped in the correct volume
c so this is OK in most cases, but it can cut into the yield of
c Cerenkov photons (eg. in a lead glass calorimeter) at the end of
c a particle track.  If this might be important, set ABAN to 0.
CKOV 1
LABS 1

c The following card prevents GEANT tracking code from abandoning the
c tracking of particles near the end of their range, once it determines
c that their fate is just to stop (i.e. electrons and protons).  This
c behaviour is normal in most cases, but in the case of Cerenkov light
c generation it leads to an underestimate for the yields.
c   ABAN 1	abandon stopping tracks (default)
c   ABAN 0	do not abandon stopping tracks
c This card is only supported by hdgeant3.

c The following card sets up the simulation to perform debugging on
c a subset of the simulated events.

c The following card can be used to turn off generation of secondary
c particles in the simulation, ordinarily it should be 0 (or omitted).

c The following card tells the simulation to store particle trajectories
c in the event output stream.  This output can be verbose, use with caution.
c The value set here determines the amount of output recorded:
c
c TRAJECTORIES = 0  don't store trajectory info
c TRAJECTORIES = 1  store birth and death points of primary tracks
c TRAJECTORIES = 2  store birth and death points of all particles
c TRAJECTORIES = 3  store full trajectory of primary tracks
c TRAJECTORIES = 4  store full trajectory of primary tracks and birth/death points of secondaries
c TRAJECTORIES = 5  store full trajectory for all particles
c
TRAJECTORIES 0

c The following tracking parameters are defined for each tracking medium
c   TMAXFD (REAL) maximum angular deviation due to the magnetic field
c                 permitted in one step (degrees)
c   DEEMAX (REAL) maximum fractional energy loss in one step (0< DEEMAX <=0.1)
c   STEMAX (REAL) maximum step permitted (cm)
c   STMIN  (REAL) minimum value for the maximum step imposed by energy loss,
c                 multiple scattering, Cerenkov or magnetic field effects (cm)
c Normally they are assigned appropriate values calculated automatically by
c Geant when the geometry is defined, overwriting the values declared by
c the user code in the GSTMED() call.  Users who know what they are doing can
c force Geant to instead use the values passed in the arguments to GSTMED()
c by removing the comment in front of the following card.  Any parameters with
c zero values are still assigned automatic values even when AUTO is turned off.
c This card is only supported by hdgeant3.

c The magnetic field map is accessed through the HDGEOMETRY library
c so that the same map can be used for both simulation and reconstruction.
c There are multiple map types and for each type, more than one map may
c exist. The map types consist of the default type of "CalibDB", the 
c constant type of "Const", the spoiled field type of "Spoiled", or
c "NoField" if the simulation should be performed with the solenoid off.
c The type is set using the BFIELDTYPE card. If no BFIELDTYPE card is
c present, then no the default type "CalibDB" is used.
c The specific parameters used for the field can be specified using the
c BFIELDMAP card. If undefined, then the default that is hardcoded into
c the HDGEOMETRY library is used. Note that these correspond to the
c similarly named configuration parameters used in the reconstruction,
c the difference being that underscores are not allowed here. To
c specify the values to the reconstruction code used here, use the
c -PBFIELD_TYPE=CalibDB and -PBFIELD_MAP=Magnets/Solenoid/solenoid_1500
cBFIELDMAP 'Magnets/Solenoid/solenoid_1200A_poisson_20140520'

c The pair spectrometer magnetic field map can also be accessed through the
c HDGGEOMTRY library in a similar fashion to the solenoid field. The cards
c PSBFIELDMAP and PSBFIELDTYPE correspond in form and meaning to BFIELDMAP
c and BFIELDTYPE, except that only "Const" and "CalibDB" (default) are
c supported values for PSBFIELDTYPE. To specify the values used here to
